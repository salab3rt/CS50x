<h1>CS50x 2022 Problem set 3 - runoff</h1>

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/runoff/<br>
<br>Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election. You should complete the implementations of the vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate functions, and you should not modify anything else in runoff.c (and the inclusion of additional header files, if youâ€™d like).
